The Broadway you see now, lined with high-end, name brand retail shops, is a result of Yale’s Broadway Redevelopment Plan. Citing dirty, unsafe streets and outdated stores unsuited for its students, Yale started buying up the existing, locally-owned properties on Broadway in 1997. Today, Yale carefully manages the entire street under “The Shops at Yale,” which also includes stores on Chapel Street. Even though Yale owns all of this real estate in New Haven, they do not pay taxes on most of their properties because of a Connecticut law that exempts most educational institutions from having to pay city or state taxes. In lieu of taxes, Yale gives a voluntary annual contribution of $11.5 million to the city, a figure [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/elicker_gov/) less than what Yale and Yale-New Haven hospital would pay in taxes based on the appraised worth of their tax-exempt properties.
