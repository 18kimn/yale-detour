In April of 2019, Hamden police officer Devin Eaton and Yale police officer Terrance Pollack shot twelve bullets at Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon, two Black New Haven residents who had been sitting, unarmed, in their car. The shooting sparked the creation of the [Black Students for Disarmament at Yale](https://www.defundypd.com) (BDSY). “We are a group of undergraduate students who, in the late hours following a 7+ hour rally on Thursday April 19, 2019, deemed it necessary to take a strong stance alongside New Haven in its fight for justice for Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon,” BDSY’s website states. 

The Yale Police Department (YPD) has a long history of racist assaults against Black students and New Haven residents. BDSY has released a zine detailing a number of them, including a 2015 incident when the YPD held Tahj Blow, a Black undergraduate student at the time, at gunpoint while he was unarmed and jogging from Sterling Memorial Library to his dorm room. Tahj’s father, the *New York Times* columnist Charles Blow, [wrote about the incident](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/opinion/charles-blow-at-yale-the-police-detained-my-son.html), inspiring public outrage over the incident.

In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, BDSY has continued to advocate for the disarmament and eventual dismantling of the YPD.
