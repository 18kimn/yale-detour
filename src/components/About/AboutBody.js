        Yale University’s namesake is Elihu Yale, a slave trader and the
        governor of the British East India Company responsible for over a
        century of colonial rule in India. This Critical History Map was
        developed with two ambitions in mind: (1) to think about how Yale’s
        history as a colonial institution remains embedded in its architecture
        and landscape in the present-day and (2) to highlight sites where Yale
        students and New Haven residents have changed the course of the
        university’s history through remarkable moments of struggle.
