        Empire is everywhere at Yale. From benefactor-named buildings
        to exclusive library access to Old Campus’ towering oak trees,
        Yale produces and affirms its own regime of truth. It is a
        truth born from revision; those in power selectively mold a
        collective memory that romanticizes Yale’s reach as one of
        progression, redemption, and (performative) reconciliation.
        Empire desires to be the only logic that people consume.
        Education is the mode through which these desires become
        attainable. Yet, histories of Yale’s present haunt every
        corner of its landscape. The student-led tour captures one of
        these many ghouls, its presentation of space a practice of
        Yale’s empire-building.

        This “DeTour” seeks to complicate readers’ conception of Yale
        as a beacon of prestige and opportunity. We see the COVID-19
        pandemic and the university’s subsequent shutdown as a moment
        of possibility in this regard; this is a chance to reorient
        and reimagine how we interact with the space Yale occupies in
        New Haven. While Yale certainly lives up to its promise of
        granting special status to inheritors of its name and legacy,
        it does so at a price. That price is protection of the status
        quo, a stasis ensuring that power is left untouched, in fact,
        strengthened. Centuries of domination and control create(d)
        Yale and bring life to its educational mission of “improving”
        the world. Divorcing past from present safeguards every tower,
        dining hall, statue, museum, stained-glass window, and even
        restroom from subversion and rupture.

        Still, as totalizing as empire and power appear at Yale, they
        are also made fragile by bringing the university’s colonial
        origins to the fore. When boundaries between the past,
        present, and future are collapsed, power’s protection withers.

          While traditional tours are meant to impart familiarity and
          comfort, this project is not intended to provide answers or
          moral reconciliation.
        </b>
        Even the physical walk to each site won’t be easy.
        Possibilities lie outside power’s grasp, but they require
        excavations within its stronghold. Each site in the “DeTour”
        initiates that excavation.
