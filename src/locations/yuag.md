The Yale University Art Gallery was founded in 1832 as “the first
college art museum in the Western Hemisphere” through the donation of
the personal paintings of John Trumbull, a famous artist and architect
from Connecticut. Transitioning a private collection into a (more)
public collection to start a museum is not unique. In Europe, most
museums began as royal collections from the elite; such “cabinets of
curiosities” were opened up to the public in late 18th century. This
was initiated by private collectors and state funded campaigns
obsessed with “studying, classifying, and ordering” the world outside
of Europe.

Objects were stolen, removed from their original spaces, and brought
back to Europe where the elite used them to justify colonialism, “on
the basis of how it was bringing process, civilization and development
to the colonies.” The museum as a site of colonial justification and
exhibition is key to its history. Therefore, it is important to
understand how the Yale University Art Gallery continues museums’
colonial legacy by positioning itself as the objective mediator
between the public and fine arts and the knowledgeable educator of
other cultures and communities.

In the recent history of the YUAG there has been increased attention
paid to the inclusion of Black and Indigenous art through more
collection building and programming to counteract its ties to colonial
history. However, this can quickly turn into the exotification and
exploitation of non-European cultures and peoples. The YUAG has moved
in some ways towards reflection and analysis but still falls into
traditions of European neutral objectivity and divorces itself from
its colonial realities.

One example of this is the continued focus on collecting ancient
African and Indigenous art with little attention to the contemporary
communities that continue these artistic traditions. Furthermore,
while these collections are growing the number of Black and Indigenous
curators remains zero though the Gallery still sees itself as an
expert of these communities’ artistic traditions. This matters for how
the YUAG is perceived and accessed by the broader community.

In June 2020, 275 individuals made up of current student guides,
alumni student guides, and Yale community members at large signed a
list of demands directed at the YUAG. In their meeting with Director
Stephanie Wiles they pressed for increases in the numbers of people of
color in positions of power and reaffirmation of the YUAG’s commitment
to serving all of New Haven. The signees are now waiting to see what
will come out of their organizing.

Museum staff and student guides alike shared discontent with the
YUAG’s relationship with New Haven and particularly with Black and
Brown communities in New Haven as those they often times feel isolated
and/or forgotten by Yale institutions like the YUAG. There are groups
within and outside of the YUAG that are hoping to change this.

Thank you to Nyeda Regina Stewart and Molleen Theodore for sharing
your perspectives on the YUAG with me. Our discussions were essential
to my thinking.
