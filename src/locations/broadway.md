The Broadway you see now, lined with high-end, name brand retail
shops, is a result of Yale's Broadway Redevelopment Plan. Citing
dirty, unsafe streets and outdated stores unsuited for its students,
Yale started buying up the existing, locally-owned properties on
Broadway in 1997. Today, Yale carefully manages the entire street
under "The Shops at Yale," which also includes stores on Chapel
Street. Even though Yale owns all of this real estate in New Haven,
they do not pay taxes on most of their properties because of a
Connecticut law that exempts most educational institutions from having
to pay city or state taxes.

In lieu of taxes, Yale gives a voluntary annual contribution of $11.5
million to the city, a figure
[hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/elicker_gov/)
less than what Yale and Yale-New Haven hospital would pay in taxes
based on the appraised worth of their tax-exempt properties.

L.L. Bean, dwell, and Sneaker Junkies are all within walking distance
of Old Campus. The presence of these stores is not organic: New Haven
is a mid-sized city with the second-highest poverty rate in
Connecticut.

We can thank University Properties (UP) for this “high- quality
retail”: UP has managed Yale’s commercial properties, including most
retail spaces on Broadway and Chapel Street. Their purported goal is
to “strengthen New Haven’s reputation as a first- choice shopping
destination.” Despite this (theoretically) noble goal, Yale has left
desirable retail spaces vacant, introduced national chains, and
massively increased rent. In light of this, how genuine can Yale’s
commitment to New Haven really be?

Yale began purchasing pieces of New Haven during the 1950’s. It first
bought properties without an obvious intention, with a few notable
exceptions (e.g. land to build new residential colleges). This “deck
of playing cards’ approach” ended with the creation of the Office of
New Haven and State Affairs in the 1990’s (and, soon afterwards,
University Properties). During this period, ONSA spent millions of
dollars beautifying Broadway, College, and Chapel Streets. It did so
through maintenance (e.g. rebuilding sidewalks) and the construction
of new buildings.

This approach excludes local businesses. National retailers can afford
exorbitant rent, while small, locally owned stores cannot afford it.
Those that do sign leases are generally expensive and well-branded.
Rather than lowering rent or loosening lease requirements for local
businesses, Yale exerts its massive financial capacity to leave retail
spaces vacant until it finds “ideal” tenants. As a result, over
thirteen desirable locations for retail stores have been unoccupied
for five years. Eventually, Yale hopes that national chains or
expensive boutiques will be willing to pay the full price. This
strategy ensures that surviving businesses cater, almost exclusively,
to wealthy Yale affiliates.

Yale employs this strategy to transform New Haven into a “first-choice
shopping destination.” According to its statement about UP, this
transformation reflects its “commitment to New Haven.” But this
nominal investment has fundamentally failed to deliver community
prosperity. Instead, it prioritizes appearances over actions. For
example, on Broadway, Yale leased J. Crew, Au Bon Pain, and similar
chains to “anchor” its investment. Similarly, it refused to renew the
leases of “undesirable” businesses and forced other long-time tenants
into new, worse locations. Yale wanted Broadway to appear wealthy and
exclusive, and it did so at the expense of many local tenants (and
less wealthy consumers).

Safety does not explain how Yale distinguishes between “good” and
“bad” tenants. The idea that affordable local businesses intrinsically
undermine safety relies on demonstrably false assumptions about New
Haven residents. To offer a safe living environment, Yale does not
need to transform Broadway and Chapel into expensive malls. It does so
anyways to produce the narrative that New Haven is for white, wealthy
college students.

It would be a disservice to discuss the Shops at Yale without an
acknowledge of the racist incident at Good Nature Market. In the wake
of the recent Black Lives Matter protests over the death of George
Floyd (and police brutality writ large), an employee at Good Nature
Market refused to allow a group of Black men to enter the store. The
owner fired the employee and immediately mandated anti-discrimination
training. Yale affirmed its solidarity to the men but then praised
“the dignity they showed in a very trying circumstance.” What exactly
“dignity” means, and whether Yale’s solidarity is contingent on it, is
not clear.
