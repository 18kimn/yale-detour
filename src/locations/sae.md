In the fall of 2015, Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE)
[held a Halloween party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/02/students-accuse-yale-sae-fraternity-brothers-of-having-a-white-girls-only-policy-at-their-party/)
during which members of the fraternity stood outside the door chanting
"white girls only" and letting only blonde women inside. The Halloween
party was one of several incidents in the fall of 2015 that culminated
in a widespread student movement against institutional racism at Yale.
