In April of 2019, Hamden police officer Devin Eaton and Yale police
officer Terrance Pollack shot twelve bullets at Stephanie Washington
and Paul Witherspoon, two Black New Haven residents who had been
sitting, unarmed, in their car. The shooting sparked the creation of
the
[Black Students for Disarmament at Yale](https://www.defundypd.com)
(BSDY). "We are a group of undergraduate students who, in the late
hours following a 7+ hour rally on Thursday April 19, 2019, deemed it
necessary to take a strong stance alongside New Haven in its fight for
justice for Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon," BSDY's website
states.

The Yale Police Department (YPD) has a long history of racist assaults
against Black students and New Haven residents. BSDY has released a
zine detailing a number of them, including a 2015 incident when the
YPD held Tahj Blow, a Black undergraduate student at the time, at
gunpoint while he was unarmed and jogging from Sterling Memorial
Library to his dorm room. Tahj's father, the _New York Times_
columnist Charles Blow,
[wrote about the incident](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/opinion/charles-blow-at-yale-the-police-detained-my-son.html),
inspiring public outrage over the incident.

In the wake of George Floyd's murder, BSDY has continued to advocate
for the disarmament and eventual dismantling of the YPD.
