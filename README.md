# The Yale Detour

The Yale Detour aims to tell alternative histories of Yale. We want to
think about how Yale’s history as a colonial institution remains
embedded in its architecture and landscape in the present-day, and to
highlight sites where Yale students and New Haven residents have
changed the course of the university’s history through remarkable
moments of struggle.

It was adapted from an in-person tour developed by Esul Burton and
Janis Jin. Work on the digital version was begun by Esul, Janis, and
Collin Bentley, and is currently maintained by Resty Fufunan, Jose
Garcia, Dora Guo, Nathan Kim, and Amy Kim.
